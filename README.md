## Intro
This is a practice repo for learning how to use Tensorflow to make neural networks.

## Files

### BasicNeuralNet.py

This is a tutorial found [here](http://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/python-tensorflow-tutorial/). The point of this is to learn the basic commands used in Tensorflow and how to display them in Tensorboard.

* To use Tensorboard to see the runs, run the following command in the project folder

```
$ tensorboard --logdir="./graphs"
```
